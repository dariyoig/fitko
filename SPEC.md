# Fitko Web Application Specification

## 1. Overview
Fitko is an AI-powered fitness system that interacts with users to gather detailed information about their fitness level, goals, preferences, and constraints. Based on this information, the AI generates a personalized fitness plan for each user. Additionally, Fitko recommends a real personal online trainer who can help the user follow and optimize their training plan, providing a blend of automated guidance and human support.

## 2. Phased Development Plan

Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing. Features not listed in the current phase are considered out of scope until their phase begins.

### Phase 1: Core UI & Basic Chat
- Home page with a chat window and basic text
- Login and registration buttons/links
- Basic authentication flow (login/register)
- Integrate OpenAI-powered chatbot for simple chat (no advanced logic)
- No admin or trainer roles yet

#### Phase 1 UI & UX Clarifications
- The landing page will feature a simple, ChatGPT-like chat window centered on the page. There will be no other pages or navigation.
- If the user is not logged in, the chat window's text bar will display Login and Register buttons. Once logged in, these will be replaced by a text input field for chatting.
- Login/register form: Chat-based authentication—the chatbot will ask for credentials directly in the conversation, keeping the experience seamless and conversational.
- Registration fields: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password.
- Password input will be hidden (no "show password" option).
- Session persistence: Users must log in each session (no "remember me" for first version).
- When logged in, a Logout button will appear at the right end of the chat input field.
- The chatbot's first message (placeholder) will be:
  "Welcome to Fitko! I'm your AI fitness coach. I'll help you create a personalized workout plan and can recommend a real personal trainer to support your journey. This app is currently under development—stay tuned for more features soon!"
- The design will use plain CSS for the first version, with a minimalistic, Apple-like style and greyish color palette.
- The app must be responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Chat history will not persist on refresh (it will reset each time).
- Error handling: Inline error messages for login/register failures.

### Phase 2: Admin & Trainer Features
- Add admin and trainer roles (with dashboards and management tools)
- Implement fixed chatbot responses and basic program creation
- Begin work on user/trainer interactions (direct messaging can be deferred)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Deployment
- Trainer recommendation system
- Data privacy and security enhancements
- AI fine-tuning and performance improvements
- Prepare for production deployment and compliance
- Additional features as needed (wearable integration, analytics, etc.)
