# Project Vision & Stack

You want to build a web app with registration/login, a chatbot using AI to question users, and generate personalized training programs.
You plan to use AI (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to help build and learn as you go.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript recommended)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- **AI/Chatbot:** OpenAI GPT-4 API (can be customized later)
- **Testing:** Playwright with TypeScript

## IDE & Tools
- Using VS Code with Copilot Pro
- Interested in Cursor for AI features (compatible with Copilot and VS Code extensions)
- Both editors are good for learning and building; you can switch between them anytime

## AI Model Customization
- For custom chatbot logic and training program generation, backend code is needed (Python recommended)
- Python is beginner-friendly and widely used for AI and web APIs

## Repo Hosting & Structure
- GitHub Pages for portfolio (dariyoig.github.io)
- Unlimited repos on GitHub; one user site plus unlimited project sites
- Recommended project structure:

## Workflow & Setup
- Create a new repo on GitHub for your project
- Initialize the folder structure above
- Use Copilot/AI chat in your editor for coding help
- You cannot transfer active chat sessions between VS Code workspaces; copy important info into a markdown file for reference

## Next Steps
- Scaffold the project structure
- Set up backend and frontend frameworks
- Configure testing tools
- Document planning and progress in README.md or NOTES.md

You can copy and paste this summary into your new repo’s README.md or NOTES.md to keep all your context and planning in one place.
